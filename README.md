# Project Title: Exploring the Relationship between Patient Attributes and Cost of Treatment

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to explore a dataset containing information about the cost of treatment for different patients. The project involves data cleaning, encoding categorical features, correlation analysis, data visualization, and analysis of the relationship between patient attributes and the cost of treatment. The project aims to gain insights into the factors that affect the cost of treatment and to practice regression analysis.

## Data Cleaning
The dataset was first checked for missing values, and no missing values were found.

## Encoding Categorical Features
Categorical features were encoded using LabelEncoder.

## Correlation Analysis
A correlation analysis was performed to identify the features most strongly correlated with the cost of treatment. It was found that smoking was the strongest predictor of the cost of treatment.

## Data Visualization
Several visualizations were created, including a heatmap, an interactive histogram, and distribution plots for smoking patients and a scatter plot.

## Analysis of Smoking Patients
Smoking patients tend to spend more on treatment, but the analysis did not confirm that the total cost of treatment in men would be more than in women.

## Analysis of Age and Cost of Treatment
In non-smokers, the cost of treatment increases with age, but this relationship is not observed in smoking patients. Patients under 20 years of age, particularly smokers, tend to spend more on treatment.

## Analysis of BMI and Cost of Treatment
Patients with a BMI greater than 30 tend to spend more on treatment.

## Conclusion
Smoking is the strongest predictor of the cost of treatment, and patients with a BMI greater than 30 tend to spend more on treatment. Non-smoking patients tend to spend more on treatment as they age, while this relationship is not observed in smoking patients. The dataset used in this analysis is relatively small, and a larger dataset would provide more reliable results. Overall, this project demonstrates the potential of data analysis to provide useful insights into various aspects of healthcare.
